This is very simple Jabberd2 web interface.
===========================================

    To get it working simply edit "app/config.php" file... (@see comments inside)

Currently supports:
    
    - User Management
    - Message Broadcasting (including group chats)
    - ...

	P.S. It works mostly directly with DB (only MySql) and config files...
